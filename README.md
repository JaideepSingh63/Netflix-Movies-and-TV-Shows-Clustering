## Problem Statement
Netflix, the worldâ€™s biggest streaming platform with over 220 million users (as of 2022 Q2), needs to organise its shows better to keep viewers happy and reduce cancellations. By grouping similar shows together using clustering, Netflix can better understand which shows or movies are alike or different. This will help the platform give more accurate and personalised recommendations to users based on what they like to watch. The main aim of this project is to group Netflix shows into different clusters where the shows in the same group are similar, and those in different groups are different, to improve the overall user experience.
